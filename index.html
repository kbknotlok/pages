  <li>All of the hosting location options seem to work just a good as the rest. There are obviously advantages and disadvantages of each, 
    though. For example, 000webhost's interface is probably the most user friendly as it is very clear on how to upload files and edit them. 
    There is a fee for some of the more advanced capabilities of the server as a disadvantage. When it comes to the csis server, 
    it is probably the hardest to navigate. Finally, and the option I prefer of the 3, is the M-Drive. It offers an interface that is easy
    to use just like 000webhost. Although it is not technically "free" to use, it is only available to students of SVSU. In this sense, I 
    feel like I am utilizing the knowledge I'm gaining in class as well as all the services that are offered to me as a student (the mdive).
